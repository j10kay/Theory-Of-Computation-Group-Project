Project Name: Snake Computation

Gameplay Overview:
In the snake game, the user is given a random DFA diagram in the left side bar, as well as a string input of random length. 
This information will be used by the user to determine if the given string is accepted by the DFA or not. 
For each question, two apples are provided, where green apple represents that the string is accepted, and the red apple represents that it’s rejected. 
Then, the user will use the movement keys (‘up’, ‘down’, ‘left’, ‘right’) to control the snake’s movement so that it consumes the apple with the correct answer displayed on it and avoids the apple with the wrong answer displayed on it.
